#
# CircuitBreaker is a relatively simple Ruby mixin that will wrap
# a call to a given service in a circuit breaker pattern.
#
# The circuit starts off "closed" meaning that all calls will go through.
# However, consecutive failures are recorded and after a threshold is reached,
# the circuit will "trip", setting the circuit into an "open" state.
#
# In an "open" state, every call to the service will fail by raising
# CircuitBrokenException.
#
# The circuit will remain in an "open" state until the failure timeout has
# elapsed.
#
# After the failure_timeout has elapsed, the circuit will go into
# a "half open" state and the call will go through.  A failure will
# immediately pop the circuit open again, and a success will close the
# circuit and reset the failure count.
#
# For services that can take an unmanagable amount of time to respond an
# invocation timeout threshold is provided.  If the service fails to return
# before the invocation_timeout duration has passed, the circuit will "trip",
# setting the circuit into an "open" state.
